	This file will help you learn to use the Epistemic Modal Logic Playground! It contains details on what features the 
playground contains and how you can use them in your modal. 
	The evaluate a formula feature allows you to evaluate propositional formulas at this model (modal evaluations coming soon)!
The formula will be evaluated at the world currently selected to display. To evaluate atoms, type the name of the atom. Try
using the following commands for other formula components. Here, F is any formula, and * is any of the operators and, or, 
implies, or if and only if:

		English        ||   Modal Language
		Not F           -        ~F
		Not (F1 * F2)   -        ~(F1 * F2)
		F1 and F2       -      F1 & F2
		F1 or F2        -      F1 | F2
		F1 implies F2   -      F1 -> F2
		F1 iff F2       -      F1 <-> F2

		
IMPORTANT: With the exception of the not operator, you MUST include exactly one space on either side of an operator between the 
two formulas that it connects! For example, F1 & F2 and F1 & F2 | F3 are valid formulas, but F1&F2, F1  |  F2, or
(F1 | F2) are not (although ~(F1 | F2) is a valid formula).
For the not operator, make sure that there are no spaces between it and the formula that it is negating. ~F is a valid formula, 
but ~ F is not a valid formula. The code currently cannot distinguish between formulas that are false and formulas that are 
syntactically incorrect, so make sure to pay close attention to the syntax of your formulas. You can also stack this operator!
Try it!
Note that the only operatorion listed above are the ones the program will accept. It has very limited capabilities to process
the parenthetical operator, and I'm still trying to write the functionality for the K[agent] operator.
